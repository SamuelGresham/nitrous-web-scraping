# Exploring the online nitrous oxide marketplace in Australia
*By Samuel Gresham*

## Abstract
Most recreational substances are classified by the Australian Government as Schedule 4 or 8 substances, and are therefore prohibited from sale on the surface web. One notable exception to this is nitrous oxide, which is classified as a Schedule 6 poison and is therefore not excluded from legal sale. Because of this, a significant market has emerged for the sale of nitrous oxide cannisters (often referred to as 'nangs') on the surface web, resulting in high drug accessibility. These sites often contain enticing services such as rapid delivery options, inclusion of administration devices (such as cream chargers and party balloons), and robust legal facades as genuine baking supply companies.

This project aims to describe the current online market for nitrous oxide in Australia, utilising web scraping to identify the top 100 sites for nitrous oxide sales on a variety of search engines and online marketplaces.
