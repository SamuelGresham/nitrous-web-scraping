# Exploring the online nitrous oxide marketplace in Australia
*By Samuel Gresham*

## Abstract
BACKGROUND Nitrous oxide is a gas which is often used in the production of whipped cream, but can also be inhaled as a recreational dissociative drug. Usage rates of recreational nitrous oxide appear to be increasing in Australia. AIMS This study aims to characterise the online nitrous oxide marketplace in Australia to understand the efficacy of current legislation and inform future legislative changes. METHODS Google Trends data was used to identify top search terms used to find sites selling nitrous oxide. Sites were then identified using these search terms, and product and other data was scraped from these sites. RESULTS A total of 93 websites were identified for inclusion, with the top 49 websites fully scraped for products. Overall, 997 products were identified, of which 696 (69.8%) contained nitrous oxide. Relatively few sites verified the age of users, and many sites provided potentially dangerous bulk pricing incentives. DISCUSSION This data indicates that legislative change is desperately needed in Australia to minimise the availability of rapidly delivered online-derived nitrous oxide. Legislative bodies should consider a range of supply and demand-based regulations to minimise the well understood personal and societal harms related to nitrous oxide use.![Uploading image.pngâ€¦]()
